Clouder
-------

Clouder is a platform which aim to standardize the good practices to host open-source softwares. Whether you are launching an hosting offer, are the sysadmin of a company or just want to host softwares for you and your friends, Clouder will allow you to easily deploy and maintain a professionnal infrastructure with very basic technical knowledge.

More specifically, it is an orchestrator which is based on the container technology (currently only support Docker), each application will be installed inside a container and Clouder will establish links between them. It is based on Odoo, an open-source software which is very efficient to manage this kind of workflow and process.

You'll find in the project the core module, clouder, which install the clouder concepts in Odoo, and the template modules (like clouder_template_odoo) which install data and functions specifics to each applications you want to host. Once you are familiar with Clouder, installing an application is as easy as filling a form! (Which mean you can automatate it with a form on your website).
And the best is, you don't need to make extensive research if you want to provide hosting for a new app, just install the template module made by others and you're set.
